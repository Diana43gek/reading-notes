# My Code Fellows Reading Notes

My thoughts on growth mindset is all about how you choose to think with allowing yourself to think positive for what you are doing.

## My three reminders to myself in the growth mindset. 
1.This is not as hard as it seems. 
1.I can make this work for me. 
1.My last thing is the more I do it the more comfortible it will feel to me.
